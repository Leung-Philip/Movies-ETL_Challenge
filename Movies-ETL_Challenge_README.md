# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
Created an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
Refactored code from the module to create one function that takes in three files (Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens data) and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
